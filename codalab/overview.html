<h1>MetaDL Challenge</h1>
<h3>Brought to you by ChaLearn, Microsoft and Google</h3>
<p>This challenge aims to find meta-learning approaches effective in the few-shot learning setting for image classification tasks. These approaches should be time efficient, that is, meta-learning procedures should not exceed a specific time boundary. More details are available in the Evaluation tab.</p>
<p>The competition is divided into 2 phases: Feedback and Final. This website is the Feedback phase portal. In Feedback Phase, the participant can develop their own approach, make submissions and check out the performance on the leaderboard for each dataset. In Final Phase, the last valid submission during Feedback Phase is blind-tested on 5 unseen meta-datasets. Results in Final Phase are used for determining the winners.</p>
<p>Participants need to submit their code through this platform. More specifically, the submitted code must respect a specific API that is detailled in the notebook tutorial. Following this API, participants will first "meta-train" a meta-learner resulting in a learner. This learner can then be trained on an unseen meta-test task and evaluated on unlabelled examples of the same task. A participant's submission will be evaluated by the capacity of this learner to quickly adapt to new unseen tasks. Please refer to the evaluation section for more details.</p>
